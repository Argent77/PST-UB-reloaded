The original readme files from PST-UB 4.12 can be found in the "readme-original" folder of this 
mod.


Overview
~~~~~~~~

This mod is a continuation of Qwinn's original PS:T Unfinished Business (PST-UB), based on 
version 4.12. It has been completely overhauled and made compatible with Planescape Torment: 
Enhanced Edition (PST:EE) in addition to classic Planescape: Torment (PST).

The mod is available in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian 
and Spanish.

From PST-UB Readme:
This WeiDU mod takes the almost-but-not-quite-finished content that shipped with Black Isle's 
classic Planescape: Torment CRPG, and finishes and polishes it so you can actually see and enjoy 
the new content in your game. And as you shall soon see, there's quite a bit of it. Version 4.0 
of this mod comes with no less than 18 full and non-trivial restorations.


Here's the short list of available components. A more detailed description can be found in the 
"Components" chapter further below.

1. "All Recommended PS:T Unfinished Business Components"
A convenience option that installs all components except "Expanded Deionarra's Truth Mod" and 
"Restored Item Cheats (Not Recommended)"

2. "Restored Able Ponder-Thought Research"
Completes a number of subjects Able Ponder-Thought will conduct research on.

3. "Restored More Morte Mortuary Moments"
Restores a bit of dialog for Morte in the Mortuary, including a more detailed introduction dialog.

4. "Restored Candlestick Quest"
Restores a quest in the Buried Village.

5. "Restored Deionarra's Truth Conversations"
Restores several dialog options regarding Deionarra's fate which are in line with what the player 
can know at that point in the game. A more complete expansion can be installed by the component 
"Expanded Deionarra's Truth Mod" below.

6. "Restored Pendant of Yemeth Quest"
Restores a quest involving six actors over two different areas, mostly in or near the Smoldering 
Corpse Bar. To start it, talk to Ratbone in Ragpicker's Square.

7. "Restored Elyce & Company Quest"
Restores Elyce, her brother and her boyfriend to the game, and there is a small quest involved.

8. "Restored Curst Citizens"
Restores seven cool new Curst Citizens with interesting dialogs.

9. "Restored Curst Prisoners"
Adds 9 more prisoners with their own dialogs to the (originally very sparsely populated) Curst 
prison.

10. "Restored Carl Parfidor"
In the original game, you can hire someone to kill Carl Parfidor, but you can never actually meet 
him. Now you can!

11. "Restored Alley of Dangerous Angles Thugs"
Restores some dialogs and scripts, so that the thugs in the Alley are actually aware of events 
unfolding around them.

12. "Restored Morte & Ingress's Teeth Banter"
Restores a very amusing (non-voiced) banter between yourself, Morte and Ingress's Teeth. Before 
Morte can use the teeth, you will need to use them with Morte nearby.

13. "Restored Items"
Restores the Fiend's Teeth, Spiked Gauntlets, Gauntlets of Rending, the Eye of Vecna, Devil's Due 
and the Chaos Feather.

14. "Restored Party Comments and Banters"
Restores 27 fully voiced flirts between Morte and female zombies, 15 new and entertaining fully 
voiced banters between various PC's, a new comment by Grace, a new soundtrack for the Smoldering 
Corpse Bar, and talking with your party members will now play that character's theme music, 
including a new track for Morte.

15. "Restored Mebbeth"
Restores two significant orphaned blocks of Mebbeth's dialog.

16. "Restored Lower Ward Encounters"
Restores 9 creatures to the main Lower Ward area, 6 creatures around Deran, the slave auctioneer 
and two characters near where Lenny hangs out.

17. "Restored Bestiary Entries"
Restores descriptions for a number of bestiary entries. It also adds a new alu-fiend entry for 
Vrischika, that has been improved to match the other bestiary images. Finally, the bestiary image 
of the TO will change from a shadowy figure to a glowing version at a point in the plot.

18. "Restored Lothar's Abode"
Restores guard creatures and minor treasure to Lothar's abode in the Lower Ward, that are found 
nowhere else in the game.

19. "Expanded Deionarra's Truth Mod"
Adds a great deal of new content (including 180 new lines of dialogue) that will allow the player 
to find out her fate before it becomes too late to do anything about it. Once the new content has 
been played, about 30-40 more lines of original dialogue will become accessible.

20. "Restored Item Cheats (Not Recommended)"
Makes two cheat items available to the player and restores their functions: the "Sword of Wh'ynn" - 
aka "The Cheater's Blade", and "The Tome o' Cheats".


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive 
into your game directory and run "setup-PST-UB-reloaded.exe".
Follow the instructions and you are ready to start. It is strongly recommend to start a new game 
after installing the mod.

PST notes:
Unfinished Business was created and tested on a clean install of the 4-CD version of Planescape: 
Torment, followed by the application of the Official PS:T Patch 1.1 available at Sorcerer's Place, 
followed by the PS:T Ultimate WeiDU Fixpack. 

Installing the PS:T Fixpack prior to PS:T Unfinished Business is very strongly recommended. The 
PS:T Fixpack readme contains instructions for creating a good base for all other mods, including 
how to patch the game if you have the 4CD version and installing your language pack if necessary.

Once the base of a patched and bug-fixed install is laid down, any other WeiDU mods you wish to 
install can be installed in any order. For example, after installing the Fixpack, feel free to 
install Qwinn's PS:T Tweak Pack before or after Unfinished Business, it should make no difference. 
All WeiDU mods are designed to play well together and introduce no conflicts with one another.

PST:EE notes:
Since PST:EE already includes the majority of the PS:T Fixpack, there is no need to install 
anything in preparation for Unfinished Business.

Important:
PST:EE patch version 3.1.4 and earlier contains a bug that will reset modded content whenever the 
party enters or resets the Modron Maze. To work around this issue, it is strongly recommended to 
download and install Generalized Biffing (http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/741-generalized-biffing/) 
as the final mod in the mod list.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. All Recommended PS:T Unfinished Business Components

This component will install the entire mod except for the components "Expanded Deionarra's Truth 
Mod" and "Restored Item Cheats - Not Recommended".


2. Restored Able Ponder-Thought Research

From PST-UB Readme:
95% of what's necessary to have Able Ponder-Thought conduct research on three subjects for you is 
in the original game files. This component completes it. As of version 3.0, it will simply take 
roughly 20 game hours for Able to complete his research.


3. Restored More Morte Mortuary Moments

This component comes in two variants. The first option applies two restorations, Morte's original 
introduction dialog and Morte commenting on Dhaal's book. The second option restores only his 
comments regarding Dhaal's book.

Morte's original introduction contains many conversation branches that are repeated in future 
conversations by Morte or other characters. Moreover, at that point of the story it doesn't make 
sense to learn too much about those topics yet. Therefore only the second option will be included 
in the convenience component "All Recommended PS:T Unfinished Business Components" (see above).

From PST-UB Readme:
This component restores two bits regarding Morte in the Mortuary. They are "Morte's Original Intro" 
which was originally restored in the Restoration Pack but which I handle completely differently, 
and "Morte Comments on Dhaal's Book" from SKARDAVNELNATE'S AIP, which I also implement somewhat 
differently.

"Morte's Original Intro:"
The main Morte dialog file the game ships with (DMORTE.DLG) contains an introductory conversation 
with Morte that is much like all the other conversations in game - you have multiple options in 
what you say, lots of different conversation paths to explore, etc. What actually shipped is a 
lobotomized version with almost no options in your responses, probably so as to introduce players 
new to RPG's more slowly to the whole experience. This UB component restores Morte's introduction 
to the originally intended more complex version. You can get quite a lot more dialogue out of 
Morte now if you dig for it.

I'm doing this completely different from the way Restoration Pack did it. Also, the entire 
dialogue is presented exactly as it was written by Black Isle, with three minor exceptions. See 
MorteIntro\tph\MorteIntro.tph if you want the details on the differences from Restoration Pack's 
handling and from the game files.

"Morte Comments on Dhaal's Book:"
Originally restored by SKARDAVNELNATE and done in a slightly different manner by Qwinn, Morte's 
walkthrough in the mortuary is extended slightly, and he will comment when you approach Dhaal 
near the beginning of the game. All content was within the game files, all that was needed were 
a couple of script changes.


4. Restored Candlestick Quest

From PST-UB Readme:
Originally restored and distributed as a stand alone restoration mod by Platter, SKARDAVNELNATE 
provided some good fixes for this restoration of a quest in the Buried Village. Most of the 
content here existed in the game files: the areas, the items, the creatures and the dialog lines, 
all were already in the game, just not enabled. Platter added a couple of triggers and actors and 
scripts to restore it, and SKARDAVNELNATE added the quests to the journal, fixed some script 
errors and corrected the colors and appearance of the actors. Qwinn added some additional 
scripting for the portals.


5. Restored Deionarra's Truth Conversations

From PST-UB Readme:
SKARDAVNELNATE'S description of his restoration: "There are several dialog options [regarding 
Deionarra's fate] that can't be accessed before the Fortress of Regrets. However a few of them are 
non specific enough where TNO doesn't need to know all the details. Using the Deionarra Sensory 
Stone and speaking with Iannis should be enough to piece together that something happened. 
Iannis's dialog is too detailed but if it is enabled it will now work properly."

Note that this is NOT the "Deionarra's Truth" mod out there that also restores Iannis's 
conversation about Deionarra's fate despite the fact that there's no way that TNO could know what 
he discusses in it. As he says, SKARDAVNELNATE's version only restores conversational bits that 
are consistent with what the player can know at that point in the game. If you want more, though, 
check out the "Expanded Deionarra's Truth Mod", newly available in UB version 3.0, that restores 
every bit of content regarding Deionarra's Truth, and adds some new content besides.


6. Restored Pendant of Yemeth Quest

From PST-UB Readme:
Originally restored by SKARDAVNELNATE, this is possibly the single biggest restoration in this mod. 
This component restores a quest involving 6 actors spanning two different areas, mostly in or near 
the Smoldering Corpse Bar. To start it, talk to Ratbone in Ragpicker's Square. Note that this is 
NOT the Ratbone that was in that area in the original game - that Ratbone gets renamed to Carver 
in the PS:T Ultimate WeiDU Fixpack for PST and by this component for PST:EE, so as to avoid 
redundancy with -this- Ratbone that is restored by this mod.

Although there were lots of typos and small bugs that needed fixing to get the quest working 
smoothly, the vast majority of the content of this quest existed in the game files, including all 
of the dialogue. The restoration mainly just adds already existing actors to the areas and scripts 
to control them.


7. Restored Elyce and Company

From PST-UB Readme:
Originally restored by SKARDAVNELNATE, with some additional fixes by Qwinn, this quest restores 
Elyce, her brother and her boyfriend to the game, and there is a small quest involved. Once again, 
the dialogues and creatures, etc., were all there in the game files. SKARDAVNELNATE just adds 
them as actors to the area, and corrects a handful of script errors. Qwinn fixed a few additional 
bugs in their dialogues.


8. Restored Curst Citizens

From PST-UB Readme:
Seven cool new Curst Citizens, originally restored by SKARDAVNELNATE, all with interesting 
dialogues dug up from within the game's unimplemented files.


9. Restored Curst Prisoners

From PST-UB Readme:
This is original to PS:T Unfinished Business, restored by Qwinn. Ever wonder why the Curst prison, 
a major planar prison, had so few prisoners in it? Not even a plague could account for how sparse 
it was. You'd see up to 3 prisoners only if you yourself sent them there, and then a bunch more 
quickly hacked to pieces later on, and that's it. There were actually 9 additional prisoner's 
dialogues coded that were never put into the area. This component puts them there. And if by some 
chance those prison doors were to ever open, and the prison erupt into riots and chaos, don't 
expect them to ignore the opportunity!


10. Restored Carl Parfidor

From PST-UB Readme:
Another cool restoration originally done by SKARDAVNELNATE. In the original game, you can hire 
someone to kill Carl Parfidor, but you can never actually meet him. Now you can! As with all other 
UB components, the dialogue enabled here was written by the Black Isle staff. And if you do have 
Carl Parfidor snuffed, you will meet a "Curst Administrative Assistant" instead, also as intended. 
Qwinn added scripting so that the hired help doesn't simply disappear and Carl doesn't just get 
magically replaced.


11. Restored Alley of Dangerous Angles Thugs

From PST-UB Readme:
This is original to PS:T Unfinished Business, restored by Qwinn. The generic thugs in the Alley 
always bothered me greatly - they seemed very unintelligent, aware only of whether or not you'd 
paid their gang's toll, and repeatedly telling you to "Stay right here, someone will be along 
shortly to talk to you" which in most of the area simply wasn't true, you were only approached 
near the area exits. Thankfully, I found other buried dialogue files (and these following the 
correct PS:T naming conventions) where they are actually aware of events unfolding around them, 
will comment on them, and they will no longer be, down to the last man and woman, maniacally 
obsessed with your 10 copper piece toll.


12. Restored Morte & Ingress's Teeth Banter

From PST-UB Readme:
This is original to PS:T Unfinished Business, restored by Qwinn. It restores a very amusing (non-
voiced) banter between yourself, Morte and Ingress's Teeth. Before Morte can use the teeth, you 
will need to use them with Morte nearby.

Please be aware that unlike all the other recommended components of Unfinished Business, this 
restoration includes dialogue not contained within the unmodded game files. Two short lines were 
needed to connect existing blocks of dialogue together smoothly. More significantly, I had to 
write an epilogue to the banter to account for a game engine limitation - namely, there is no way 
to automatically equip Morte with the teeth, but that's how the original banter ends (which was 
probably why the banter was cut from the game in the first place). Almost all of the dialogue up 
to him having them equipped is original Black Isle material, everything after that was written 
by me to account for the limitation.

Since such an epilogue was necessary to 'finish' the content, I decided to have fun with it. I 
hope you'll find my epilogue as amusing as the original content. It's certain that Annah (if 
she's there) will find it so. I do continue the original banter's providing of both a "good" and 
"evil" track, at least for a little while.


13. Restored Items

From PST-UB Readme:
As of version 2.0, the items restored to the game by this component are the Rat Charm, the Fiend's 
Teeth, Spiked Gauntlets, Gauntlets of Rending, the Eye of Vecna, Devil's Due and the Chaos Feather. 
All except the Rat Charm were originally restored in the Restoration Pack.

Version 3.0 of the Ultimate WeiDU Fixpack fixes the bug with the usability restrictions on the Rat 
Charm. It is now usable only by Xaositects, as was intended. Previous workarounds that made it 
usable only by Chaotic characters have been rolled back. The rat charm is available from Barking 
Wilder if you are a Xaositect, you ask him the right question, and you have the right component 
item in your inventory. If you install this component without installing the Fixpack, you will not 
be able to use the Rat Charm (PST only).

The Fiend's Teeth (usable by Morte), Spiked Gauntlets and the Gauntlets of Rending are sold by a 
merchant named Murk who is restored to Curst. His store already contained these items, all I do is 
restore the merchant.

The Eye of Vecna will not become available until later in the game... be sure to check with 
Vrischika if you come back after leaving Sigil for any length of time.

Devil's Due and the Chaos Feather will be found in a container somewhere within the walls of Sigil - 
or at least, it's reputed to be, though no one knows for sure.


14. Restored Party Comments and Banters

From PST-UB Readme:
Version 1.0 and 2.0 of UB did not add any new banters and only 3 voiced comments. One was 
originally restored in the Restoration Pack, a comment by Grace about Fell the first time she 
enters the Hive area containing his parlor. Qwinn added another two, both in the main Clerk's 
Ward area, one when Morte first enters it and another when Grace first enters it.

Version 3.0 of Unfinished Business, however, has greatly expanded this component. It restores 
27 fully voiced flirts between Morte and female zombies, which can be enjoyed right at the 
beginning of the game. Morte will chime in a moment or two after talking to any female zombie. 
Also added are 15 new and entertaining fully voiced banters between various PC's, and a new 
comment by Grace that she'll say one time when entering most areas of the Hive for the first time. 
Note that you're unlikely to ever see the 15 new banters unless you install the accelerated 
banter component in Qwinn's Tweak Pack for PST or one of the available another banter 
accelerators for PST:EE.

Version 4.0 adds even more restored sounds and banters - I combed through every available sound 
file, and this version pretty much restores every banter that can be sanely restored. Also, new 
and more music! the "Smoldering Corpse Alternate" theme music from the official PS:T soundtrack 
will now play at night (game time, of course) in the Smoldering Corpse Bar. Finally, talking with 
your party members will now play that character's theme music, as several of those themes were 
very rarely played otherwise in game. Morte's theme music did not ship with the game, but talking 
to him will play his main theme from the official Planescape Torment soundtrack. Both of these 
tracks from the soundtrack are by Mark Morgan.

PST:EE notes:
For technical reasons it is not possible to implement individual NPC reactions for locked doors 
and containers, or copying spell scrolls to the spell book. Since PST:EE is still actively 
maintained by Beamdog, it is possible that this feature will be implemented by a future game patch. 
This component will restore the generic sound effect for copying spell scrolls to the spell book, 
however.


15. Restored Mebbeth

From PST-UB Readme:
This component, new to version 3.0 of UB, restores two significant orphaned blocks of Mebbeth's 
dialogue. One block is several lines worth and was supposed to occur after you sleep in her hut 
via her dialogue option to do so, and actually leads to a new journal entry. Another block of 
dialogue is "Mebbeth's Tale of Ravel", which you will only be able to get from her before you 
leave for Ravel's maze, and it also leads to a new journal entry. Sound interesting? It is.


16. Restored Lower Ward Encounters

From PST-UB Readme:
This component, new to version 3.0 of UB, is packaged along with the rest of the Recommended 
components. It restores 9 creatures to the main Lower Ward area, 7 of them with previously unseen 
dialogues that shipped with the original game, and also brings back an existing character for a 
little bit of extra original dialogue that you couldn't get after she left the Lower Ward.

The best new addition is Hailcin'n, a scarred and tattooed githzerai warrior who wanders in the 
same general area as Kii'na. A very colorful character, he thankfully doesn't seem to hold 
Dak'kon's history against him. This was an easy restoration - the game files already included his 
creature file, his dialogue file, and his walking-around script. All I needed to do was put him 
in place, and do a couple of very minor dialogue corrections. His dialogue is quite detailed, and 
adds a lot of flavor.

Another 6 creatures are placed based on two unused dialogue files, representing customers 
standing around Deran, the slave auctioneer. Much like the customers at Giltspur's auction, 
there are 3 males and 3 females. Talking to any one of them can produce one of 3 random dialogues 
for that gender, again the same as occurs with Giltspur's customers. No corrections to the 
dialogues were necessary, but I did have to pick creature sprites and write a script for them 
based on the (fixed by the Fixpack) Giltspur customer script. They also add a good deal of flavor 
to that area.

Another two characters, laborers working on some strange unidentified device, are restored near 
where Lenny hangs out. This is restored based on a complex script that existed for the worker that 
moves around. There wasn't any special interactive dialogue files for them, but there are a good 
number of original floating text lines. If you do try to talk to them, I gave one a generic Lower 
Ward citizen dialogue and the other has an original "I'm working, leave me be" dialogue line that 
I didn't find being used elsewhere.

Finally, if you give Ki'ina information that causes her to leave the Lower Ward, she will now 
return about a week later so that you can enjoy the rest of her dialogue that was previously 
inaccessible.


17. Restored Bestiary Entries

From PST-UB Readme:
This component, new to version 4.0 of UB, was originally restored by Kung Fu Man in his 
Restoration Pack. Most of these restored text entries were incorporated in Fixpack v3.0, but as 
of version 4.0 are now separated into this UB component. Affected bestiary entries are Annah, 
Dak'kon, Dhall, Dustmen (both male and female), Grace, Ignus, Lothar, Nordom, Trias and Vhailor.

In addition, the game's dialogue included an alu-fiend text entry for the bestiary, but no 
corresponding portrait was available. Thankfully, SHS forum poster MaeBe responded to my request 
for a modified version of the Aasimar portrait, and poster Leila improved upon it further to make 
the included portrait for Vrischika an excellent addition to the bestiary. I think it fits the 
PS:T style quite well, and I am very grateful to both posters for lending their excellent artistic 
skills to this project.

Finally, thanks to our engine guru scient, you can now see the updated bestiary picture for TO in 
game. The portrait will switch from a vague unlit portrait to a fully lit portrait when you first 
see him in person, which is marked by a short movie. Make sure to check it out before starting 
dialogue, as your chances to see it may be very limited afterwards.

Modding notes:
The mod expands the bestiary functionality for PST:EE, so that it can display different images 
based on one of two supported variable definitions in BGEE.LUA. The new field 'iglobal' defines 
the variable to check exclusively for images. If this variable is not found 'global' is checked 
instead. It is fully backwards compatible with the default implementation of the unmodded game.


18. Restored Lothar's Abode

This component restores an unused creature as well as an unused item to Lothar's home in the 
Lower Ward area. The creature is a Ghoul Stone Golem. You can find one of them guarding the 
chamber of skulls and another one protecting the treasures in Lothar's private chambers. The 
treasure includes a minor magical artifact not available elsewhere in the game.

The component will also add two additional instances of Gorgon Salve to the game, which may have 
an additional use in Lothar's home. You can find one Gorgon Salve somewhere in the Brothel of 
Slating Intellectual Lusts. Another instance can be purchased from Pestle after helping him out. 
The original inventory icon of the item was also shared by Embalming Fluid. This component 
replaces it with another icon that was previously unused in the game.


19. Expanded Deionarra's Truth mod

From PST-UB Readme:
I am not including this in the "Recommended" section of the installation procedure because it 
contains a lot more new content than restored content, but I recommend it anyway. As noted in the 
partial "Restored Deionarra's Truth Mod" listed above, not every original conversation regarding 
Deionarra's ultimate fate could be restored because the player couldn't know everything he needed 
to to have those conversations until it was too late. This mod adds a great deal of new content 
(including 180 new lines of dialogue) that will allow the player to find out her fate before it 
becomes too late to do anything about it. Once the new content has been played, about 30-40 more 
lines of original dialogue will become accessible.

Note a few important things if you install this component: A closet in your room in the Festhall 
that could previously be opened easily will now remain firmly locked until the end of this quest 
(items it contained have been moved and remain accessible earlier). The quest will not be available 
until after you have returned to Sigil after a long trip elsewhere. Visit an important character 
in Ragpicker's Square at that time to start the quest, and pay attention to any hints Ravel might 
drop about items you should hold on to, you will need one to complete this quest properly (the 
hint is actually part of her original dialogue, I didn't add it). Your TNO will have to be able 
to handle a pretty tough fight by himself too, and a very nice prize awaits those who complete 
the quest (although it is both class and alignment restricted). Lastly, this new quest gives an 
existing long quest that dead-ended rather anticlimactically some sense of closure.

I must repeat: You MUST keep an item from Ravel's Garden through most of the game to complete this 
quest. This item has multiple other uses. You may have to forego the other uses to keep one until 
you need it near the end of the game. You have been warned. And if you can't open a certain closet 
that you used to be able to, this component is why.

The overall content of this mod - including the tie-in to the existing quest just mentioned - was 
approved by Chris Avellone, lead designer of Planescape: Torment, and the plot and dialogue also 
received strong approval from Colin McComb, original designer of the area where most of the quest 
takes place.


20. Restored Item Cheats (Not Recommended)

From PST-UB Readme:
Vrischika's dialogue has disabled conversation paths where she offers to sell you the "Sword of 
Wh'ynn" - aka "The Cheater's Blade" - and "The Tome o' Cheats". Their descriptions indicate what 
they are supposed to do, but neither of them actually did anything. Restoration Pack enabled them, 
allowing you to buy both of them and read the descriptions and, in the case of the Sword of Wh'ynn, 
reenabled it's power (which is basically to skip ahead to the final game cutscene, which basically 
just spoils the ending, which is why I don't recommend that one).

Note that this in actuality also restores a third item - as buying either of those two items from 
Vrischika also makes a new tattoo available from Fell (what doesn't?).

Restoration Pack also claimed to enable some of the Tome o' Cheats options, but did not in fact do 
so. The Unfinished Business version, however, does. And it will make the game trivially easy, 
which is why I don't recommend it (except for modders looking to test their mods, which is the 
only reason I bothered to make it). The Cheats available in the UB version 1 Tome of Cheats are 
the Teleport Cheat, Rest Anywhere Cheat, Wealth Cheat, Attribute Score Cheat, Death Cheat, 
Experience Cheat, Word 'o Good and Evil Cheat, and Word o' Law and Chaos Cheat.

Two things of note about the Tome o' Cheats. One is that Qwinn's PS:T Tweak Pack also contains a 
Tome o' Cheats tweak, the difference being that with the Tweak Pack mod you start the game with 
the Tome o' Cheats in your possession, whereas in this component you have to wait until you get 
to Vrischika (as was... *cough*... "intended") a fair ways into the game before you can buy the 
Tome (and it's... rather expensive from her). The other thing of note is that this has -nothing- 
to do with Platter's Tome o' Cheat mod, which I've never even downloaded or seen. The dialog you 
see when you use the book is entirely authored by Qwinn. The conversation with Vrischika about 
the book is what was contained in the original files, and the only thing there that I modify 
slightly is the listing of the cheats available in the Tome.

PST:EE notes:
The game already comes with a powerful debug console that makes this component largely redundant. 
It might still be useful though, since many cheats are conveniently presented as dialog options.
