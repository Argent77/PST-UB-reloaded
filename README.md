# PS:T Unfinished Business - Reloaded
*A mod for PST and PST:EE, based on Qwinn's PS:T Unfinished Business*

## Overview

This mod is a continuation of Qwinn's original *PS:T Unfinished Business* (PST-UB), based on version 4.12. It has been completely overhauled and made compatible with Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition in addition to classic Planescape: Torment.

The mod is currently available in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish.

**From the original PST-UB readme:** *This WeiDU mod takes the almost-but-not-quite-finished content that shipped with Black Isle's classic Planescape: Torment CRPG, and finishes and polishes it so you can actually see and enjoy the new content in your game. And as you shall soon see, there's quite a bit of it. Version 4.0 of this mod comes with no less than 18 full and non-trivial restorations.*
